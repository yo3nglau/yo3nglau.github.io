## Plot

### Prologue

In the Second Age of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Middle-earth{{< /font >}}, great Rings of Power were forged. Three were given to the lords of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elves{{< /font >}}, seven were given to the lords of the {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Dwarves{{< /font >}}, and nine were given to the Kings of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Men{{< /font >}}. However, the Dark Lord {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Sauron{{< /font >}} had secretly forged {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}The One Ring{{< /font >}} in the fires of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Mount Doom{{< /font >}}, and had imparted great portion of his power into {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}The One Ring{{< /font >}} to dominate the other Rings and rule {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Middle-earth{{< /font >}}.

After becoming wise to the Dark Lord's scheme, {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Men{{< /font >}} and {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elves{{< /font >}} formed an Alliance and battled {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Sauron{{< /font >}}'s forces in {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Mordor{{< /font >}}. In the battle, {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elendil{{< /font >}}, the King of the {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Men{{< /font >}} of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Gondor{{< /font >}}, was slain while attempting to attack {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Sauron{{< /font >}}. {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elendil{{< /font >}}'s son {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Isildur{{< /font >}} then took up his father's broken sword, {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Narsil{{< /font >}}, and severed {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Sauron{{< /font >}}'s fingers, which removed the Ring from the Dark Lord's hand. Being separated from the Ring caused {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Sauron{{< /font >}}'s spirit to depart his bodily form, and it seemed that the Alliance of {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Men{{< /font >}} and {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elves{{< /font >}} was successful in defeating him.

After the battle, {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Isildur{{< /font >}} followed the Elf {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elrond{{< /font >}} to the {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Cracks of Doom{{< /font >}}, where {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Elrond{{< /font >}} implored him to cast the Ring into the Mountain's fires and destroy it. However, {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Isildur{{< /font >}} refused and kept the Ring for himself. The Ring's influence corrupted {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Isildur{{< /font >}}, and he was later slain while walking into a river flee an {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Orc{{< /font >}} ambush. The Ring fell into the river and was lost for hundreds of years until it was found by {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Gollum{{< /font >}}, who owned it for several centuries. The Ring later abandoned {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Gollum{{< /font >}} and was found by a Hobbit named {{< font name="TOLKIEN.TTF" >}}Bilbo Baggins{{< /font >}}.
