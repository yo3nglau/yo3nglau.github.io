## TLDR

**Categories** are broad topics that help you organize your blog posts, and help readers find the information they’re seeking on your site.

**Tags** are a simple way to drill down on the topic of any given blog post that’s part of a category.

## Description

These two words may be used interchangeably, but they are not the same thing. The difference is simple: A category is a broad topic you cover in your blog. It acts as the umbrella to a bunch of smaller topics. Blog tags are one small idea in an overarching topic.

## Pro Tips

- Don’t go overboard with tags. Have tags about 5 to 10 maximum per category. Don’t need to add more than three to four per blog post.
- Keep them short — between 1 and 3 words.
- Don’t use different variations of the same word.
- Constantly adding content with created tags. Consistency is key. 
- Don’t create a blog tag that is too specific.
